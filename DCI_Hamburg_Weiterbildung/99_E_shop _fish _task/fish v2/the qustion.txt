Get rid of the addFishToOrder function and create a new function that accepts

arguments. The number of the tunas the customer wants to put to his cart,

the number of salmons, and finally the number of kois.

For example when called the function: newFishOrder(5, 2, 1) that means the

customer wants to buy 5 tunas, 2 salmons and a koi fish.

First we need to check if we have 5 tunas in our stock, if yes we add them to

the basket with all necessary info. If not, we add as many as we have (if 3, then 3)

At the end we calculate the cost of the cart for the customer.

In our case is going to be 5 tunas 10 + 2 salmons 50 + 1 koi * 100 = 250 dollars.

If we have only 3 tunas then to give then of course the cost is 230 dollars.
